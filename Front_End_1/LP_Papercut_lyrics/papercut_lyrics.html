				Why does it feel like night today?<br>
				Something in here's not right today<br>
				Why am I so uptight today?<br>
				Paranoia's all I got left<br>
				I don't know what stressed me first or how the pressure was fed<br>
				But I know just what it feels like to have a voice in the back of my head<br><br>
				
				Like a face that I hold inside<br>
				A face that awakes when I close my eyes<br>
				A face that watches every time I lie<br>
				A face that laughs every time I fall (and watches everything)<br>
				So I know that when it's time to sink or swim<br>
				That the face inside is here in me<br>
				Right underneath my skin<br><br>

				It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back<br>
				It's like a whirlwind inside of my head<br>
				It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within<br>
				It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin<br><br>

				I know I've got a face in me<br>
				Points out all my mistakes to me<br>
				You've got a face on the inside too<br>
				And your paranoia's probably worse<br>
				I don't know what set me off first, but I know what I can't stand<br>
				Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is I can't add up to what you can<br><br>

				But everybody has a face that they hold inside<br>
				A face that awakes when I close my eyes<br>
				A face that watches every time they lie<br>
				A face that laughs every time they fall (and watches everything)<br>
				So you know that when it's time to sink or swim<br>
				That the face inside is watching you too<br>
				Right inside your skin<br><br>

				It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back<br>
				It's like a whirlwind inside of my head<br>
				It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within<br>
				It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin<br><br>

				It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back<br>
				It's like a whirlwind inside of my head<br>
				It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within<br>
				It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin<br><br>

				(The face inside is right beneath your skin)<br>
				(The face inside is right beneath your skin)<br>
				(The face inside is right beneath your skin)<br><br>

				The Sun goes down<br>
				I feel the light betray me<br>
				The Sun goes down<br>
				I feel the light betray me<br><br>

				(The Sun) it's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back<br>
				It's like a whirlwind inside of my head<br>
				It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within<br>
				It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin (I feel the light betray me)<br>
